# Updating Documentations

When the changes apply to the user APIs or any other parts of the code that are relevant, the appropriate documentations should 
also be updated.

## Hosting the docs

PyPDFForm uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for building the documentations. To host the doc site locally simply run:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

And you will find the doc site at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Working with the docs

The doc site utilizes markdown files. Feel free to use any [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/) when working with the docs.
