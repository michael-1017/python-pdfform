# Hosting Docs Locally

Update the relevant documentation when changing user APIs or other significant code sections.

PyPDFForm uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build its documentation. To host the documentation locally, run:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

The documentation will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

Alternatively, to run the documentation in the development container:

```shell
docs
```

The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`.
