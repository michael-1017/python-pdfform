# 2024-01-01: API Changes

Happy new year fellow developers! We start the year 2024 with a new release of v1.4.0 and 
there are some important changes I'm making to the APIs of the library.

* The PDF object that gets instantiated is now `PyPDFForm.PdfWrapper`, changed from `PyPDFForm.PyPDFForm`.
* Form widgets are now accessed via the `PdfWrapper.widgets` attribute, changed from `PdfWrapper.elements`.
* The JSON schema of the form data is now accessed via a new attribute called `PdfWrapper.schema`, 
changed from the old method of `PdfWrapper.generate_schema()`.

All the old APIs will be persisted for half a year and then fully deprecated. Each of them 
will emit a `DeprecationWarning` when invoked, so it is advised that you make the switch before they are 
removed and start breaking your code.

Happy hacking!
