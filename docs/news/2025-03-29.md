Hello fellow Python developers! With the release of v2.0.0, there are some important changes I'm making to the library:

* Since I started developing the library, versioning releases has been quite unorthodox, and there isn't any convention I followed. Starting with v2.0.0, PyPDFForm will version releases following the conventions defined by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
* PyPDFForm now renders PDF form widgets! Ever since its ancestral stage, the library has only been able to render the data you filled into a PDF form. Now if you fill a PDF form using `PdfWrapper`, the result will render the whole widget instead of just the value that got filled. If you would like to disable this behavior, please refer to the docs [here](https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/fill/#disable-rendering-widgets).

Happy hacking!
